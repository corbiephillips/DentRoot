Answers to the dsi-sql excercises
Individual excercise answers:
Select statements: 
Q2 SELECT userid FROM users;
Q3 SELECT DISTINCT campaign_id FROM users;v
Q4 SELECT * FROM users WHERE campaign_id='FB';

Aggregation functions:
--Going to skip some for time because they are easy--
Q2 SELECT count(userid), campaign_id FROM users
   GROUP BY(campaign_id);
 
---paused on Aggregate Functions #8, which has this weird 'date_part structure' I don't understand. The underlying skill to learn is how to take the 'dt' file dna d make a WHERE caluse off of only part of it. Lots of ways to do that'

Aggregate function q8 - about date_part. Oh, it's just a function designed to pick out parts for a data-formatted data
 
windows functions seem to be a common solution, learn about them.
