Plan of action:
1. Find a relevant data set 
     https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php looks very very promising
     Going with the 2018-19 Report Card database
     Correction, go with california data, like from **cde.ca.gov/ds/dd** or similar. Having local data will help you apply a *little* more domain knowledge, and that
     could a big difference. It will also help in making the findings you display in your portfolio more interesting to potential employers, especially California
     Public school systems!!
2. Import into Postgres
3. Clean and analyze!!

June 1:
I have downloaded the 2018-19 Report Cards set as a zip file. How to get into into Postgres?
If I can get the file into .sql format on the desktop, I can get it to user Rosie's download section, and run 
\i c:/users/rosie/readychef.sql 
which is what worked for readychef.
