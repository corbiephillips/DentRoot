PORTFOLIO ITEM 1: 

Possible Research Questions:
1. How does Pacifica School district compare to others in region?
2. What school districts in the area are the best performers?
     Then find a way to cross compare with affordability of housing in those districts?
3. What school districts in the state have had the most dramatic drop offs from say 2013 to 2018? The biggest gains?
4. What school distrcits have NOT gotten better as the districts around them have gotten better?
5. Many of the questions might be more interesting at the school level, not the district level. 
6. For example, what schools have not gotten better when the district around them has gotten better? And which schools have gotten better/stayed better 
   as the district around them gets worse?
   
Research notes, ideas: 
1. In this space, there will be lots of report, visualizations etc, many interested in your same questions. It will be good to see if you are getting the same results 
   for questions like 'which is the best school district'
2. As you reading Brookings, the trades, etc, you will get more ideas for research questions. 
3. A lot of the type of questions you are interested in will require statistical implementations, which will be interesting. 

TABLE RELATIONSHIPS: 



Plan of action:
1. Convert to SQL and get loading into your postgres
2. Understand the data - what the headers area, how tables relate. Domain knowledge, etc. 
3. Play around, pull out insights.

Getting data into Postgres. 
I have downloaded the 2018-19 Report Cards set as a zip file. How to get into into Postgres?
If I can get the file into .sql format on the desktop, I can get it to user Rosie's download section, and run 
\i c:/users/rosie/readychef.sql 
which is what worked for readychef. 

Going to find California data sets, and import those and start playing with those. 
Also, going to try leetcode challenges. (leetcode challenges, banks fo interview questions, and 1-2 projects in a portfolio, and I can start applying. Look at the salary ranges now though)
California data: Found a good one here: https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/ResearchFileList?ps=true&lstTestYear=2019&lstTestType=B&lstGroup=1&lstGrade=13&lstSchoolType=A&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000#dl
but they are only available in csv and txt format. How to convert csv to sql file? I am trying sqlizer
